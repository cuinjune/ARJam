# ARJam

AR Jam aims to create a new music creation environment by leveraging the Augmented Reality technology. This iPad music-making app will allow the user to place multiple AR musical instruments (e.g. drum machine, synthesizer) on the desk and play with them through the iPad's touch interface.

As the user moves the iPad in close proximity to an AR musical instrument, the instrument’s 3D interface will animate to an interactive, touchable 2D interface on the iPad. If the user moves the iPad away from the instrument, the 2D interface will animate back to the 3D interface. With this approach, the user can efficiently navigate between multiple instruments while simulating a hardware instrument’s creative process.

The user will also be able to create and place AR speakers on the desk, implementing an immersive 3D audio experience within this music creation environment.  Lastly, the app will allow the user to invite other AR Jam users to play the instruments together in the same space. These music sessions will be recordable and shareable.
